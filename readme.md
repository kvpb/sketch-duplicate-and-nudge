##### Manual

- `[Alt] + [{Arrow}]`: Duplicate and nudge horizontally or vertically.
- `[Shift] + [Alt] + [{Arrow}]`: Duplicate and nudge diagonally.*

If you need to nudge by any other amount, just edit the .skethplugin files with a text editor, replacing 1 and 10 for your favorite numbers :)

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;Examples

- `[Alt] + [Right]`: Duplicate and nudge right.
- `[Shift] + [Alt] + [Right]`: Duplicate and nudge right-down. 

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;*

Duplicate and nudge diagonally works clockwise such as:
- Up for up-right
- Right for right-down
- Down for down-left
- Left for left-up
